Hey! I’m Rafael, part chemist, part maker, full time crazy scientist.
This site is where I dump experiments, half-finished projects, weird ideas that keep me up at night, and occasionally (really occasionally), things that might actually work.
It’s part lab notebook, part digital cave wall — mostly insane rambling from a mind that refuses to sit still.

You’ll find posts about chemistry experiments, DIY sensor systems, custom electronics, whatever strange rabbit hole I’ve fallen into this week, and thoughts that may or may not have practical applications.
(Most don’t. Yet. But hey, that’s half the fun.)

If that sounds up you alley do stick around. 


# Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

# Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

# Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](https://fontawesome.com/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
